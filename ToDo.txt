UPDATE COMMENTS

Modify :
------------------------------------------
Entities.scala
	>Add mid-level monsters.
	
queueEnemies();
	>Change percentage chance based on level number or in general more advanced. (See generatesLevel(); note)
	>Right now it also seems weak and sometimes barely any monsters spawn. Must be more.

generateLevel(Level:Int);
	>Make the parameter actually do something. As of right now it does nothing and is a pointless addition.
	>Possibly via multiplying the level by some number and making that increase the chances of getting a tougher monster?
  
Need to also add these features :
------------------------------------------

	> [IMPORTANT] Need to have a way to keep level environments consistent no matter how many times you enter a room.
		>Possibly via a 10 length array that keeps track of it.
		>Can be updated via : arrayName(curLvl) = LevelEnv;
	> [REQUIRED] Ammunition for bow.
	> [Very Optional] Add spells that require ammunition?
