Modify :
------------------------------------------
bossEntry();
	>Will be used to setup proper enemy variables for use against Boss. Also should include some dialogue.
  
typeDamage();
	>Needs additions regarding all monster types.
	>Look into a more efficient way of doing what I've planned. Using if statements for each weapon and monster seems long and redundant.
  
dicerolls();
	>Needs to adjust percentage chance of a miss. It seems rather high at the moment.
  
reset();
	>Doesn't actually restart the game. Only resets variables. Need to fix it.
  
treasure();
	>Add possibility to get nothing.
	
attack()/enemyAttack();
	>Review values for a miss. They seem rather frequent and they aren't supposed to be that way.
	
generateLevel(Level:Int);
	>Make the parameter actually do something. As of right now it does nothing and is a pointless addition.
  
Need to also add these features :
------------------------------------------

*Working on it ( A little bit. )
Create a way to apply some sort of percentage decrease or increase of damage depending on what weapon you are using against certain enemies.
  tldr; enemies need strengths and weaknesses to certain attacks.
  
  > Add different classes. Mage, Warrior, Archer etc etc..
