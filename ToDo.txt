Need to modify the following functions :
------------------------------------------

combat();
  Needs to repeat until queue.isEmpty.  /This is in Game.scala\
  Possible way to fix :
    while (queue.nonEmpty)  {
      while (plyHP > 0 etc etc...)
      if (enemyHP <= 0) {
        queue = queue.drop(1);
      }
    }

Need to create the following functions :
------------------------------------------

enemyAttack();
  Fairly obvious what this will do. If there is any doubt refer to attack(); and apply damage to the player.

treasure(); 
  Will be used for awarding HP back to player after defeating whatever monster is in the room.

move();
  Will be used to navigate in between rooms. North, South, East, West.
  Also we need to include some sort of way to check if a player has already entered a room or not and if he has;
    then there shall be no monsters present in the room.

bossEntry();
  Will be used to setup proper enemy variables for use agaisnt Boss. Also should include some dialogue.
  
Need to also add these feature :
------------------------------------------

Create a way to apply some sort of percentage decrease or increase of damage depending on what weapon you are using against certain enemies.
  tldr; enemies need strengths and weaknesses to certain attacks.
