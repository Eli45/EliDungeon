Modify :
------------------------------------------
move();
  Need to include the if statements depending on what room you are in. Otherwise done.
  Add to Explored Array. So that it tracks levels.
  
bossEntry();
  Will be used to setup proper enemy variables for use against Boss. Also should include some dialogue.
  
typeDamage();
  Needs additions regarding all monster types.
  
dicerolls();
  Needs to adjust percentage chance of a miss. It seems rather high at the moment.
  
Need to also add these feature :
------------------------------------------

*Working on it ( A little bit. )
Create a way to apply some sort of percentage decrease or increase of damage depending on what weapon you are using against certain enemies.
  tldr; enemies need strengths and weaknesses to certain attacks.
