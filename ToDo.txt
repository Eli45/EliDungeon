UPDATE COMMENTS

Modify :
------------------------------------------
Entities.scala
	>Add mid-level monsters.
	>Be sure to update the specific type damages to correspond with this change.

/*
generateLevel(Level:Int);
	>Make the parameter actually do something. As of right now it does nothing and is a pointless addition.
	>Possibly via multiplying the level by some number and making that increase the chances of getting a tougher monster?
*/ Decided against this. Random is better in my opinion.
  
Need to also add these features :
------------------------------------------

	> [IMPORTANT] Need to have a way to keep level environments consistent no matter how many times you enter a room.
		>Possibly via a 10 length array that keeps track of it.
		>Can be updated via : arrayName(curLvl) = LevelEnv;
		>if (arrayName(curLvl).exists) { println("You enter the "+arrayName(curLvl)+ "+direction+" room.");
		>else { normal operations and add level desc to array. }
	> [Very Optional] Add spells that require ammunition?
