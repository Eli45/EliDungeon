Modify :
------------------------------------------
bossEntry();
	>OP boss.
  
typeDamage();
	>Needs additions regarding all monster types.
	>Look into a more efficient way of doing what I've planned. Using if statements for each weapon and monster seems long and redundant.
  		
generateLevel(Level:Int);
	>Make the parameter actually do something. As of right now it does nothing and is a pointless addition.
  
Need to also add these features :
------------------------------------------

*Working on it ( A little bit. )
Create a way to apply some sort of percentage decrease or increase of damage depending on what weapon you are using against certain enemies.
  tldr; enemies need strengths and weaknesses to certain attacks.
  
  > Add different classes. Mage, Warrior, Archer etc etc..
