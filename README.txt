#Story
==========
Kan/Keg Krusher Kelman has usurped power from the standing King. 
You, a lowly knight must venture in the depths of his cavern where he now rules the kingdom from.
If you do not succeed the kingdom is surely doomed to a thousand years of darkness.

#Description
==========
Dungeon Adventure Game by Eli Furland created for Kan Krusher Kelman's class.
Very basic text-based program.
Have fun, hopefully it was worth the weight.

#Instructions/Guide
==========
Follow the on screen instructions. It should fairly straight forward. Your goal is to get to Kelman's room and defeat him.
Hotkeys to the right of the listed weapon can be typed into the console for quick attacking. Looks like: 'name'(x).
Ammo for weapons that require it is listed as [x], to the right of the hotkey.
